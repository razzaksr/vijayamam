Form validations:
to validate forms we have few annotations from jars of hibernate validation

Adding annotation in model class
@Size(min=,max=)
if condition fails it gives default error msg

meanwhile in controller add @Valid annotation too

Custom Messages:
1. @Size(max,min,message="custom message with {max}{min}")
2. Writing exculsive property file for messages to do that we need to add messageSource id of bean from ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource with property file location
	In property file syntax can be,
	Annoation.objectOfBean.property=messasge{0} and {1}
{}---> these are all plcaeholders
also we can avoid  to restart server for every changes by cacheSeconds value 1 as property in messageSource
More annotations:
@Pattern(regexp="")
@Past
@Future
@Max
@Min
@Null
